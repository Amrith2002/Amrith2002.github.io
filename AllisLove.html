Love....Yes Love.
<br><br>
What it is or what it means is something most of the people dont fully understand. From the very moment a child is born the one thing he 
craves so much..is this love or we may call it affection. Even though much of us don't actually get how powerfull the word "love" is, we
all need it. 
<br><br>
We live for love. 
<br><br>
We fight for love. 
<br><br>
Even the countless wars raged by humans were to keep their loved ones protected and happy.
<br><br>
Now in all these words of wise-sayings here comes a boy. A boy who has gone through his fair share of happiness and sadness,
anger and calm, failure and prosperity...
<br><br>
But what he could never go through was love and his war with love.. Yes, war..
<br><br>
As someone who tries to spend most of his time in solitude (he was not like that from the beggining,but life's hard choices made him select
the way of solitude and tranquility), he never wanted the bad memories or the bad (have to say "very bad" but I wont term it as worst
because people go through harder problems) experiences to ever happen again.
<br><br>
Fearing this he locked himself away in a room filled with darkness...a room with just him and all the monsters he has ever dealt with..
There was noone to help him...Trust me when i say noone I mean noone..
<br><br>
Oh yes he had lovely parents, A good brother and many good relatives (bad ones are there too haha XD)...but none really was able to help him..I 
wont complain because every person has their fair share of problems right...
<br><br>
So in this circle of him, his monsters and recurrent panic attacks, he not even in his wildest dreams would have thought he would ever 
get a day out of this madness...
<br><br>
But as I said how much ever a man is broken...He will crave love....and he craved love....But what did his alter-ego have to tell him?
he had to tell him to shut up and shut down...
<br><br>
Ah and that could have been the end...
<br><br>
But that fellow up there...That guy likes to create climaxes and twists in each persons life...so much as if he enjoys it lol...
But needless to say his decisions are like sometimes nerve-racking but sometimes his decision are hard to believe..
<br><br>
So this dude or this boy or he or whatever met a girl...umm, dont know what happened but as soon as he saw her fireworks were in his 
heart....it was like he was in love but he was so confused that he didnt know what the hell he was even feeling...the feeling 
<br><br>
Was raw....
<br><br>
Was pure...
<br><br>
Was so absolutely amazing and paining at the same time...
<br><br>
But in was this monster who told him to shut down and shut up...haha there is someone stronger than that monster up there...and so that fellow
up there...he
<br><br>
He was like this boy here and that girl there...umm they are nice...they have been throught their difficulties...and for what?
For this moment...that moment when that girl decided to text on an old friend..And yeah here we are 12 months...with each other..with the most
favorite person in our lives sitting next to each other...
<br><br>
So Baby all this dramatized writing is just to get that feeling...that feeling that we cherish but soetimes forget to remember..
what we were and where we are now...
<br><br>
sooo the only thing i want to say...no...its a felling that I have felt....That I cant explain...that love...that unconditional love...
that you give me that you have given me that makes it so beautifull baby...what you mean to me is something i cant write in a million 
words...or show you in a million hugs or kisses...youre so much to me in so little of time because the feeling i felt..
<br><br>
When I first saw you, When i first heard you, When i first talked with you,<br>
Touched you....<br>
Felt you....<br>
is something so unearthly...The connection i felt was not physical or emotional or mental...it was something else....I saw you yet noone 
else saw....I touched you yet noone else will agree...I kissed you yet people will tell thats a blasphemy...the raw pleasure of love 
that moves through my body, mind and soul when you touch me....
<br><br>
These feelings are something I cant say or express but only me and only me can feel all these...
<br><br>
Baby....I just want to say thak you for all that you have given me and i just want to say.....I love you...
<br><br>
because i believe those three words are the strongest in the world...
<br><br>
lots of love for you my darling and lots of kisses and hugs too....
<br><br>
Wishing us a very <br>
Happy anniversary...<br>
